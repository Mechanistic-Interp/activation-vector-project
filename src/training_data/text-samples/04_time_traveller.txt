# The Burden of Sight

Dr. Elena Vasquez materialized in the shadow of the Great Pyramid of Giza, her temporal displacement device humming quietly as it recalibrated to 2467 BCE. The desert air hit her lungs with shocking clarity—no pollution, no industrial smog, just pure Egyptian heat and the distant sound of construction crews working on monuments that would outlast civilizations.

Elena had spent fifteen years perfecting temporal travel technology, driven by an obsession with witnessing history firsthand rather than piecing it together from fragments and speculation. This was her seventh jump, and she had learned to pack light: water purification tablets, solar chargers for her equipment, and a universal translator that could adapt to ancient dialects within hours of exposure.

She had come to observe the construction of the pyramid's inner chambers, but fate had other plans.

The tomb she discovered wasn't on any archaeological map, hidden beneath a collapsed section of limestone that had shifted over millennia. Her ground-penetrating radar had detected the void, and her curiosity had proven stronger than her caution. The entrance was narrow, requiring her to crawl through passages that clearly hadn't been disturbed since their original sealing.

Inside, hieroglyphs covered every surface in obsessive detail, telling a story that made Elena's blood run cold. Khenti-Ka, a high priest of Thoth, had been accused of using forbidden knowledge to see beyond the veil of time itself. The pharaoh had ordered him entombed alive, but not before Khenti-Ka had inscribed his final curse into the very walls of his prison.

"Let those who seek the sight beyond mortal ken inherit my burden," Elena translated slowly, her headlamp illuminating symbols that seemed to writhe in the flickering light. "Let them know the weight of seeing what is, what was, and what must come to pass."

At the chamber's heart lay a sarcophagus unlike any she had studied. The limestone was carved with mathematical formulas that predated known Egyptian mathematics by centuries, and inlaid with metals that her spectrometer couldn't identify. Most disturbing were the eye symbols—thousands of them, each carved with such precision that they seemed to track her movement around the room.

Elena should have left. Every instinct screamed danger, but scientific curiosity overrode survival instincts. She photographed the inscriptions, took measurements, and finally—fatally—touched the sarcophagus lid.

The pain hit her like lightning, coursing through her nervous system and rewriting something fundamental in her brain. She collapsed, convulsing, as visions flooded her consciousness. She saw Khenti-Ka's final moments, felt his desperation and rage as tomb workers sealed him in darkness. But worse, she felt his knowledge pouring into her mind like molten metal.

When she regained consciousness hours later, the world had changed.

Elena could see the quantum threads that connected all things—past, present, and future spreading out like a vast web. Her first coherent thought came with the crushing realization that her research assistant, David, would die in a car accident in three days. She could see it with perfect clarity: rain-slicked roads, a moment of distraction, twisted metal under fluorescent emergency lights.

She activated her temporal device and jumped back to her own time, materializing in her laboratory with tears streaming down her face. David looked up from his computer, concerned by her obvious distress.

"Elena? The jump was only supposed to last six hours. You've been gone for two days. What happened?"

Elena stared at him, seeing not just his present concern but the shadow of his future death overlaying his features like a double exposure. "David, I need you to promise me something. Thursday morning, don't drive to work. Take the subway, call in sick, anything. Just don't drive."

"What? Elena, you're scaring me. What did you find?"

She couldn't tell him the truth. How do you explain to someone that you can see their death approaching like a storm front? Instead, she made excuses about temporal disorientation and stress, but she watched him constantly for the next three days.

Thursday morning came with torrential rain. Elena had barely slept, her mind assaulted by visions of accidents, diseases, and tragedies that stretched across the globe. She could see a building collapse in Tokyo next month, a epidemic starting in Mumbai next year, political assassinations that would reshape governments. The knowledge was relentless and precise, and utterly useless because changing anything seemed impossible.

David, confused by her increasingly erratic behavior, ignored her warnings and drove to work anyway.

Elena watched the accident happen in real time through her enhanced sight. She saw the moment David's phone buzzed with a text, saw his eyes leave the road, saw the truck running the red light with a drunk driver at the wheel. She was thirty miles away, but she experienced every second of the collision as if she were sitting in the passenger seat.

The funeral was worse. Standing beside David's casket, Elena could see the ripple effects of his death spreading outward like cracks in glass. His girlfriend would sink into depression and lose her job. His mother would develop heart problems from grief. His unborn children—twins he would never have—flickered in and out of existence like ghosts.

Elena tried to lose herself in work, but the curse had made her research impossible. Every historical jump was contaminated by her knowledge of what was coming. She would arrive in ancient Rome already knowing which emperors would die, which buildings would burn, which plagues would ravage the population. The past had become a theater where she knew all the actors' fates before they spoke their first lines.

Months passed in a blur of sleepless nights and avoided human contact. Elena could see the death and suffering of everyone she met, and the weight of that knowledge was crushing her sanity. She tried everything—meditation, medication, even attempting to surgically damage the parts of her brain that had been altered—but Khenti-Ka's curse was woven into her DNA now, rewriting her neural pathways faster than she could destroy them.

The breaking point came when she looked in a mirror and saw her own death.

It would come in six months, she realized. Not from age or disease, but from a choice she would make. In her laboratory, late at night, she would activate the temporal device one final time and set the coordinates for the moment of the universe's heat death—the ultimate escape from a curse that had made her the unwilling witness to all of existence's suffering.

Elena understood now why Khenti-Ka had been so desperate, why the pharaoh had feared his knowledge enough to bury him alive. The gift of sight beyond mortal understanding wasn't a blessing—it was the cruelest punishment imaginable. To see all of time spread out before you, to know every tragedy that would unfold, and to be powerless to change any of it.

She sat in her empty laboratory, surrounded by the temporal research that had once filled her with purpose, and began counting down the days until her own prophesied end. Six months to live with the knowledge of everyone else's death, and the terrible comfort of knowing exactly when her own suffering would finally cease.

Outside her window, the city hummed with eight million people going about their lives, blissfully unaware that somewhere in a cluttered laboratory, a time traveler sat weeping for futures they would never see coming.

The curse of Khenti-Ka lived on, passed from one seeker of forbidden knowledge to another, a reminder that some mysteries are buried for good reason, and some doors should never be opened.
